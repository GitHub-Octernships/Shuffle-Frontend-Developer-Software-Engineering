# Assignment

## Build a Web Form Generator that connects to Shuffle workflows

### Task instructions 📝

Users should be able to build standalone forms inside Shuffle that can be shared with others, and when an action is performed (form opened, form submitted, etc), it triggers a flow inside Shuffle workflow such as ``Form Submitted -> Fires a trigger inside Shuffle workflow -> Workflow sends an email to hello@shuffler.io``.

### Task Expectations 👩‍💻👨‍💻

- Be able to create and build forms inside Shuffle with all standard input types.
- The form needs to be accessible to outsiders with just a link.
- Actions performed on the form need to connect to the workflow as triggers.
  - Don't worry about what workflow will be like. The goal is to make sure something is triggered when an action is performed on the form.
  - Feel free to test your form on this usecase: ``Form Submitted -> Fires a trigger inside Shuffle workflow``.
  - If your standalone form can fire a trigger inside Workflow, we'll consider your assignment complete.
